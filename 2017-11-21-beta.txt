The question should be 'If each branch is a commit' and not 'if each
box is a commit'

I couldn't get the history using git log dental, git log repl/dental
or any other path with or without / as a first path character. So I
changed my location with cd dental and ran git log once there. But I
couldn't read any similar character in the history I obtained,
compared with ones in the instructions. The hint wasn't helpful
either.

In the first chapter, a hash was identified from the results of 'git
log' command. But here, it says hash can't be seen using the 'log'
command. In fact, none of the hash numbers match any of the possible
answers. [very confusing]

None of the possible answers are printed by commands: 1. cd dental;
2. git log

Could not find hashs in dental repository. Also git log path doesn't
work for git log dental/ but does work inside dental folder. Lastly
sometimes command line is unresponsive after git log command.

Have we gone over how to find out what directory we are in currently
in?  I typed 'git log' and nothing returned.  I typed git status, and
nothing returned.  I typed 'cd dental', and then typed 'git log' and a
list of commits were returned....but none matching the numbers given
in the answer choices.  It would be nice to have a verbal explanation
of the steps necessary to answer the question...especially if some of
the commands have not been introduced.

None of these answers provided are correct.  Need to run 'cd /dental'
then 'git log'. After spacing down to the bottom. NONE of the hash's

commit 04975ea3d13221f0790cdb1add044fa7cbf1f3ea    This is the most
recent commit when we use the git log command in the console, so how
the correct answer 2e1b743c related to this. this is unclear

in the exercise, none of the commands work in the terminal. We are
asked the first 6 characters of the latest commit but the log command
does not work.

You need to use cd dental before entering any git quires, which is
likely to confuse people as it wasn't required in previous
chapter. Additionally the possible answers don't appear to match the
hashes from the commits.

I have had a lot of practice learning about data science but I know
almost nothing about file structures except for where my file folders
should be and that the documents I create go into documents, and the
files I download go in downloads, and bot are easily accessible
through icons in my file shortcut.  I'm not so sure I understand what
a root is, and why the .git goes there.  Maybe show some more explicit
examples because I'm pretty sure the .git can go anywhere you want to
put it....i think.

The answer is a bit confusing.  Need to elaborate on what is implied
by a 'root directory' with respect to where files are stored or which
folder contains the files.

This question assumes that the students understand directories. This
may not be the case for many of the students. It would be beneficial
for them to have a bit of an introduction to directories and the
console.
