Have we gone over how to find out what directory we are in currently
in?  I typed 'git log' and nothing returned.  I typed git status, and
nothing returned.  I typed 'cd dental', and then typed 'git log' and a
list of commits were returned....but none matching the numbers given
in the answer choices.  It would be nice to have a verbal explanation
of the steps necessary to answer the question...especially if some of
the commands have not been introduced.

None of these answers provided are correct.  Need to run 'cd /dental'
then 'git log'. After spacing down to the bottom. NONE of the hash's

commit 04975ea3d13221f0790cdb1add044fa7cbf1f3ea    This is the most
recent commit when we use the git log command in the console, so how
the correct answer 2e1b743c related to this. this is unclear

in the exercise, none of the commands work in the terminal. We are
asked the first 6 characters of the latest commit but the log command
does not work.

tried git log but no hash matched the answer

You need to use cd dental before entering any git quires, which is
likely to confuse people as it wasn't required in previous
chapter. Additionally the possible answers don't appear to match the
hashes from the commits.

I don't understand the differences between the a/data/northern.csv and

+22,4 @@? The examples showed @@ -1,4 +1,4 @@ and the explanation was
that four lines (1-4) had been removed and replaced with new lines,
but there are only two lines below in the line by line listing. Also,
what do the following lines indicate: 2017-08-13,incisor,
2017-08-13,wisdom, and 2017-09-07,molar if only the last one
(+2017-11-01,bicuspid) indicates a change to the repository?

In this excercise you need to state how many lines were altered. While
I saw the one line being added, and correctly picked 1, I did not
understand the @@ 22,3 22,4 @@, as this is different from the
example. In the example I thought 1,4 meant lines 1-4. I guess sure
22,3 does not mean 22-3, so I'm confused even though I got the
exercise correct.

It is not clear, which file I should check for changes:   Use git diff
to look at the changes to dental/data/northern.csv. How many lines
have been changed in the file bin/teeth?

It's a little unclear how @@ -1,4 +1,4 @@ is interpreted. Perhaps it
would be useful to include the explanation that it's @@ -<start
line>,<number of lines> +<start line>,<number of lines> @@. As it
stands it possible to confuse @@ -1,4 as referencing -<start
line>,<end line> because the end line & number of lines are the same

The following is a little unclear: "A line starting with @@ that tells
where the changes are being made. Here, the line shows that lines 1-4
are being removed and replaced with new lines." In my exercises, I get
-22, 3 and +22, 4, and I am not sure whether it means lines 22-23 has
been removed, and lines 22, 23, 24 has been added, or to think that
there are 3 lines being removed and 4 lines being added.

This exercise isn't clear for me. The intro of the question is about
the file "northern.csv" and the actual question is about the file
bin/teeth. If you use the command "git diff bin/teeth" nothing
happens. If you use "git diff" on the file northern.csv you can see
that one line is added. The answer "1" is correct for the file
"northern.csv" and not for the file "teeth"

This would be more effective with arrows and explanations on an
annotated copy of the diff.  Also,  i find i'm always writing 'get'
instead of 'git' and I wonder what 'git' stands for.  Is it an
abbreviation for something?  I think I would remember to type 'git' if
I had something to associate with it.

there is a lack of clarity here: "--- a/report.txt and +++
b/report.txt, which indicate that lines being removed are prefixed
with -, while lines being added are prefixed with +." Since a and b
are place holders, that is to say, both might contain removed and
added lines, so it is better to use " --- a/report.txt and +++
a/report.txt, which indicate that lines being removed are prefixed
with -, while lines being added are prefixed with +."

I have had a lot of practice learning about data science but I know
almost nothing about file structures except for where my file folders
should be and that the documents I create go into documents, and the
files I download go in downloads, and bot are easily accessible
through icons in my file shortcut.  I'm not so sure I understand what
a root is, and why the .git goes there.  Maybe show some more explicit
examples because I'm pretty sure the .git can go anywhere you want to
put it....i think.

This question assumes that the students understand directories. This
may not be the case for many of the students. It would be beneficial
for them to have a bit of an introduction to directories and the
console.
