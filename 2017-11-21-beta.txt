How does Git store information?

I'm not familiar with git so I could be wrong here. But if the bottom
commit is the most recent it appears that the report file doesn't
change and that the actual data does as it's a new blob, so
data/northern.csv should be the correct answer?

It's unclear that the answer is just line B. Does altering the
position of line B count as change? This only occurred in the master
file because line A was deleted. it might be helpful to clarify that a
line is considered to be altered if it's position alters (because of
the deletion of another line) or only if it's contents are altered.

The most recent one changed the 'report.txt' [git show HEAD]. What is
required is: Before that recent, it changed the 'western.csv' [git
show HEAD~1]. For git show HEAD~2, it changed both 'western.csv' and
'southern.csv'. Hence the feedback saying 'it also changed another
file' is wrong.

The instructions say to use HEAD to view the most recent commit and
HEAD~1 to view the one before that, but nothing happens when I type in
"git diff HEAD" and "git diff HEAD~2" seems to give me the correct
answer instead of HEAD~1.

git show HEAD~1 gave a commit message of changed data for the western
region, and as far as I can tell only changed 1 file data/western.csv

EUREKA!!!  The commands worked!!  The output of 'git show HEAD~1
returns a diff of a particular commit.  I don't know if this is
actually the intended output.  But I can tell there are particular
sections, each with specific information.  It would be nice to have an
annotated diagram naming theses sections (if they in fact have names)
and detailing what the information refers to.  I do remember one
exercise with an explanation saying something about pluses (+) and
minuses (-) correlating to additions and deletions.  But there's so
much more information.

What is a hash?

I couldn't get the history using git log dental, git log repl/dental
or any other path with or without / as a first path character. So I
changed my location with cd dental and ran git log once there. But I
couldn't read any similar character in the history I obtained,
compared with ones in the instructions. The hint wasn't helpful
either.

In the first chapter, a hash was identified from the results of 'git

command. In fact, none of the hash numbers match any of the possible
answers. [very confusing]

Have we gone over how to find out what directory we are in currently
in?  I typed 'git log' and nothing returned.  I typed git status, and
nothing returned.  I typed 'cd dental', and then typed 'git log' and a
list of commits were returned....but none matching the numbers given
in the answer choices.  It would be nice to have a verbal explanation
of the steps necessary to answer the question...especially if some of
the commands have not been introduced.

You need to use cd dental before entering any git quires, which is
likely to confuse people as it wasn't required in previous
chapter. Additionally the possible answers don't appear to match the

I have had a lot of practice learning about data science but I know
almost nothing about file structures except for where my file folders
should be and that the documents I create go into documents, and the
files I download go in downloads, and bot are easily accessible
through icons in my file shortcut.  I'm not so sure I understand what
a root is, and why the .git goes there.  Maybe show some more explicit
examples because I'm pretty sure the .git can go anywhere you want to
put it....i think.

This question assumes that the students understand directories. This
