# Introduction to Git for Data Science

This course is an introduction to version control with Git
for data scientists
who know just enough about the Unix shell
to run simple commands and edit text files.

## Step 0: Learner Profiles

Please see the [DataCamp Learner Profiles][profile-site] for details.

- [Anya][profile-anya] has been using Subversion on the Unix command line for years,
  but has never used Git.
  This course will show her the similarities and differences between the two.

- [Jasmine][profile-jasmine] has never used version control,
  and has only just completed DataCamp's "Introduction to the Unix Shell".
  Most of the ideas in this course will be new to her.
  She will be disappointed to discover that Git doesn't handle Microsoft file formats cleanly.

- [Thanh][profile-thanh] has used Git from inside RStudio,
  but has never branched or merged.
  This course will show him what's going on under the hood when he does a commit,
  and how to collaborate with colleagues through GitHub.

## Step 2: Summative Assessment

1. Clone the Git repository whose URL you have been given.
2. View the changes made in the most recent commit.
3. Create a new branch called `rewriting-conclusion` and switch to it.
4. In that branch, remove every occurrence of the word "not" from the last paragraph of the file `report.txt`.
5. Commit your changes with the log message "Correcting conclusions".
6. While still in that branch, pull in the content of the `rewriting-intro` branch from the repository you cloned.
7. Merge the changes in that branch with the changes you just made,
   keeping your changes to the last paragraph
   and all of their changes to the other paragraphs.
8. Push the merged to a newly-created branch called `rewriting-conclusion` in the repository you cloned.
