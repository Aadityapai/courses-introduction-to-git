## How does Git compare to alternatives?

Git and other version control systems are the only way to track and share work.
Some popular alternatives are:

1. *Email.*
   Lots of people mail files back and forth,
   but it's hard to keep track of which version is the most recent,
   and even harder to be sure that everyone's edits have been merged together.

2. *Putting files in a shared network drive or on Dropbox.*
   This is more convenient than email,
   but still makes people do the work of tracking changes.

3. *Online editing.*
   Tools like Google Docs work well for small groups,
   but it's hard to keep track of changes as the number of contributors and comments grows.
