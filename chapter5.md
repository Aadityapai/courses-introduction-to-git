title       : Collaborating
description : >-
  Version control is not just a way to keep track of your own work:
  it's a scalable way to collaborate with other people.  This chapter
  shows how to use the features you have already seen, plus a special
  kind of bookmark called a *remote*, to share your code, data, and
  conclusions with others.
